# ME VR Attempt

Native VR mod for Mass Effect Legendary Edition (BioWare's UE3 fork): a C++ ASI plugin loaded by
ME3Tweaks' LEBinkProxy, on top of LExSDKv2. One VR system for LE1/LE2/LE3, built LE1 first. Game
mechanics may change to fit VR (see `docs/trilogy-design.md`).

## Licensing rules (MIT project)

- Copy code only from permissive sources (REFramework is MIT) and keep their notices.
- Overlord, h2-mod and Legendary Explorer are GPL-3.0: **read for design, never copy or translate code.**
- UEVR and TF2VR are all rights reserved: never clone or copy.
- LExASIs and LEBinkProxy have no license: read for patterns; ask ME3Tweaks before copying.
- LExSDKv2: use as a git submodule only, never vendored into `src/`.

## Layout and workflow

- `research/`: sourced findings. Record new findings here with sources. Mark unverified UE3
  assumptions **[verify]** and update the hypothesis table in `research/08-ue3-hypotheses.md` as
  they're confirmed or refuted.
- `docs/`: plans and decisions. Keep them consistent with `research/`.
- `reference/`: read-only third-party clones (gitignored). Recreate with `tools/fetch-references.ps1`.
- `notes/game-inventory.md`: exe versions and hashes from `tools/inventory-game.ps1`. Re-run after
  game updates.
- Game install: Steam app 1328670, currently `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mass Effect Legendary Edition`.
- Dev machine: RTX 4090, Quest via the Oculus OpenXR runtime, VS 2022 Build Tools (no IDE), CMake.

## Gotchas

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 turns native stderr (e.g. git progress) into errors under
  `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`. Check `$LASTEXITCODE` instead.
- msbuild isn't on PATH; use a VS developer shell or CMake.
